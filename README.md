SandPIM is a simple, LAMP-based Product Information Management system built around the AutoCare Association's ACES and PIES standards. The "Sand" in the name is a 
reference to the Sandpiper protocol that is starting to take shape in the AutoCare community (as of Fall, 2019). SandPIM serves a platform for testing concepts core to Sandpiper as they are being debated before adoption.
